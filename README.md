# Flying Navigation System Support

## 2025 Hiatus Notice
Hi everyone.

Thank you all so much for the support of the Flying Navigation System plugin. I couldn’t have imagined it’d be so popular, but I’m very glad it’s been a useful tool (and made it into a few published games!). These past few years I’ve been very happy to provide support for the plugin, updating with new features and fixing bugs as well as stepping through troubleshooting. However, as I’ve planned for a while, I will be going on a backpacking trip from February 2025 until the end of the year. As such, support for the plugin will be going on a temporary hiatus. Because I won’t have a laptop with me, I won’t even be able to update the plugin to newer Unreal versions (beyond 5.5), which is rather unfortunate. I will see if I can maintain this minimum of support by tracking down a computer somewhere, but I cannot guarantee it.

With all that in mind, I’m by no means planning on abandoning the plugin. I still have not completed the project I built it for in the first place, so my plan once I get back is to dedicate more time to that project, which in turn will require improvements and new features in the Flying Navigation System.

For anyone that’s bought the plugin recently and feeling short-changed by this announcement, I’d be happy to put through any refunds. For those looking for support next year, I have tried to make the documentation as comprehensive as possible, and this discord server has an extensive history of troubleshooting and application discussions. I will also still be around in January, cleaning up some final points and able to help.

Cheers everyone,

Ben.

You can get extra support and join the discussion on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/eHsYcRa4JU) support server.

## Demo Projects
Download the FlyingDemo project and play around with it. A packaged version is available from [Releases](https://github.com/BlenderSleuth/FlyingNavSystemSupport/releases), or you can clone and build it yourself (don't download with the GitHub button though, because the repository uses [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/)).

There is also a benchmark project which I used for the benchmarks [here](https://blendersleuth.github.io/FlyingNavSystemSite/benchmarks.html).

## Reporting Issues
For bugs or feature requests please open an [issue](https://github.com/BlenderSleuth/FlyingNavSystemSupport/issues) on this repository, or find help on Discord.
