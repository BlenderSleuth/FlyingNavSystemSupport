# Flying Navigation System Support

## Documentation
Please see [here](https://blendersleuth.github.io/FlyingNavSystemSite/) for full documentation.
You can get extra support and join the discussion on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/eHsYcRa4JU) support server.

## Demo Projects
Download the FlyingDemo project and play around with it. A packaged version is available from [Releases](https://github.com/BlenderSleuth/FlyingNavSystemSupport/releases), or you can clone and build it yourself (don't download with the GitHub button though, because the repository uses [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/)).

There is also a benchmark project which I used for the benchmarks [here](https://blendersleuth.github.io/FlyingNavSystemSite/benchmarks.html).

## Reporting Issues
For bugs or feature requests please open an [issue](https://github.com/BlenderSleuth/FlyingNavSystemSupport/issues) on this repository, or find help on Discord.
